### Currently supported

## Options

#### Sync Interval

Modification of this option isn't recommended, since Settings Sync will detect local settings changes and sync accordingly.

By default, it checks every 5 minutes (300 seconds) for upstream changes. You can change this value in the settings, but keep in mind that too low of a value will probably result in you getting rate limited by Github.
